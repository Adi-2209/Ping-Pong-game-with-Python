Ping-Pong Game with Python using turtle graphics

The code has complexity in terms of designing the game mechanics. Eg: Moving the ping pong ball back and forth between  the two players.
There are several if-else statements in the code to check various conditions like setting the limitations of the ball 
This code utilises many user defined functions as a part of game design 
The code imports rules and conventions of the game from a txt file and prints it onto the screen to let the player know before they begin playing. Also imports a lot of images for character selection.
Uses plenty of python built in functions like readlines(), range(), global() etc.
The game design includes animation using event driven components.
The code runs well in codio with turtle graphics

The overall message or the theme of the project is to recreate the ping pong game graphically using python and turtle graphics. Play a fun game and check out who wins: you or the computer!
